# üì° Digital Modulation Schemes in Python

This repository contains simulations of various digital modulation techniques using Python and NumPy/SciPy. The purpose is to visualize and understand baseband signal characteristics such as waveform shape, frequency spectrum, and constellation diagrams. Each modulation technique includes plots to illustrate its unique properties.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying)

- Maps 1 ‚Üí +1 and 0 ‚Üí -1
- Simple real-valued signal
- Spectrum shows sinc-like shape due to rectangular pulse
- Ideal for low-complexity applications

### Output:
- Time-domain waveform (real-valued)
- Frequency spectrum
- Spectrogram

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying)

- Each symbol represents 2 bits
- Symbols lie on 4-point constellation in I-Q plane
- In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) modulate cosine/sine carriers

### Output:
- Constellation diagram (4 points)
- Time-domain I and Q waveforms
- Spectrum of I and Q components

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ FM (Chirp Signal)

- Simulates Frequency Modulation using a chirp (linear frequency sweep)
- Signal sweeps from low to high frequency over time
- Not a digital modulation but included to show continuous frequency variation

### Output:
- Time-domain signal
- Spectrogram (shows frequency sweep visually)
- Spectrum

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ 16-QAM with Raised Cosine Filtering

- 4 bits per symbol ‚Üí 16 constellation points
- Each axis (I and Q) maps 2 bits via Gray coding
- Raised Cosine filter applied for pulse shaping (bandwidth control)
- Matches real-world DACs with interpolation and filtering

### Parameters:
- Symbol rate: 10 MHz
- DAC sampling rate: 100 MHz (10√ó oversampling)
- Filter: Raised Cosine (roll-off: 0.35)

### Output:
- 16-QAM constellation (before and after pulse shaping)
- Real/Imaginary time-domain waveform
- Raised Cosine filter improves spectral efficiency

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ OFDM with QPSK (Wi-Fi 802.11a Style)

- Uses 64-point FFT, 52 active subcarriers (data + pilot)
- Cyclic Prefix: 16 samples (to combat multipath)
- Modulation: QPSK on each subcarrier
- Demonstrates frequency-domain orthogonality

### Parameters:
- Sampling rate: 20 MHz
- FFT size: 64
- CP length: 16
- Active subcarriers: ¬±26 (Wi-Fi 802.11a style)

### Output:
- I/Q waveforms (time domain)
- Frequency spectrum
- QPSK constellation (for one symbol)
- Power Spectral Density (PSD)
- Cyclic Prefix visualization
- Subcarrier sinc shapes (to show orthogonality)
